1)Write a C# Sharp program to swap two numbers. 
Input the First Number : 5
Input the Second Number : 6
Expected Output:
After Swapping :
First Number : 6
Second Number : 5

2)Write a C# Sharp program to print the output of multiplication of three numbers which will be entered by the user. 
Input the first number to multiply: 2
Input the second number to multiply: 3
Input the third number to multiply: 6
Expected Output:
2 x 3 x 6 = 36

3) Write a C# Sharp program to print on screen the output of adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing of two numbers which will be entered by the user. 
Input the first number: 25
Input the second number: 4
Expected Output:
25 + 4 = 29
25 - 4 = 21
25 x 4 = 100
25 / 4 = 6
25 mod 4 = 1

4)Write a C# Sharp program to that takes three numbers(x,y,z) as input and print the output of (x+y).z and x.y + y.z. 
Test Data:
Enter first number - 5
Enter second number - 6
Enter third number - 7
Expected Output:
Result of specified numbers 5, 6 and 7, (x+y).z is 77 and x.y + y.z is 72
5)Write a C# program to that takes a number as input and display it four times in a row (separated by blank spaces), and then four times in the next row, with no separation. You should do it two times: Use Console. Write and then use {0}. 
Test Data:
Enter a digit: 25
Expected Output:
25 25 25 25
25252525
25 25 25 25
25252525
8)Write a C# program to convert from celsius degrees to Kelvin and Fahrenheit. 
Test Data:
Enter the amount of celsius: 30
Expected Output:
Kelvin = 303
Fahrenheit = 86
9)Write a C# program to compute the sum of two given integers, if two values are equal then return the triple of their sum. 
10)Write a C# program to get the absolute value of the difference between two given numbers. Return double the absolute value of the difference if the first number is greater than second number.
