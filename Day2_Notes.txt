------------------------------------

Methods:
1)static---
a)are methods that have static keyword in the declaration/signature of the method.
b)They can be directly called on the class.



2)non-static/instance----
-------------------------------------------------------

Why OOPs
Procedural Paradigm-----> only procedure/methods and no entity reference is available so
dealing with real time scenarios could not be handled.

Entity handling can be done using class and methods/behavior related to that entity can also be written in the class along with the attributes/properties of the entity.

Class --- blueprint/template which represents the entity.

Each object created out of the class represents one instance of the entity.

Object is instance of the class.
