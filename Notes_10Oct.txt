Delegates
---------
Middle Person who is working on behalf of someone.

We create a delegate that works on behalf of the method.

1) Delegate should have same signature as that of the method.

public void AddEmployee(int empno,string ename,int age);

public delegate void AddingEmployee(int empno,string ename,int age);

Use of Delegates:
1) Event Handling
2) Mutli-threading
3) Call backs
4)Language Integrated Query
